What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Reflection: metadata describing the commit and status of the repository is added or updated.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Reflection: the working directory has "work in progress" and not yet completed, the staging area has work "completed parts of the work" and the repository has "completed work".

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Reflection: I will either make sure that all the changes in staging are for one logical change, or I will only commit those files from staging that are for one logical change. This means that I should not modify a file with two or more logical changes and then add it to staging.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Reflection: fixing an older version, creating a localized version, creating a platform-specific version

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Reflection: the diagram indicates which changes are included in each branched version of the repository
