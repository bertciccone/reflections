What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Reflection: metadata describing the commit and status of the repository is added or updated.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Reflection: the working directory has "work in progress" and not yet completed, the staging area has work "ready for completion" and the repository has work "completed".
