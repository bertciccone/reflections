When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Reflection: when I plan to distribute my project or collaborate with another developer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Reflection: I may not be ready to use the changes that are in remote and that are not yet included in my repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Reflection: forks make a copy of a remote repository on GitHub and start a new remote branch, clones copy a remote repository from GitHub to my computer, branches create a new set of commits that are not included in the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Reflection: you can review the latest remote changes before actually merging them into your branch. Also, you can review them while offline, as when you are on a plane.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
